          <p>
            I am a computer science graduate from Reykjavik University, Iceland.
            About 16 years ago my interest in programming was sparked when I
            started the middle school that journey only lasted for one semester
            and I had to start working full-time to support myself, but ever
            since then I've always been very much interested in programming, but
            it wasnÂ´t until 2018 I decided to get a BSc degree so I could learn
            more from people who are smarter than me.
